# Photos

Photos is an Android application that demonstrates the use of Android Architectural Components such as ViewModels, RecyclerView and data persistence with Room. For example, a RecyclerView is used to display a scrolling list of photos in an attractive masonry-style layout. The user can tap on an image thumbnail to see a large version of the photo and tap on the heart icon to favourite the photo. Favourited photos are persisted to an SQLite database using the Room library.

## Features
